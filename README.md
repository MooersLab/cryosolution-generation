# Excel workbook to compute recipes for a series of cryosolutions for the cryopreservation of protein crystals

## Purpose: 

Remove the stress and hassle of computing the recipes for a series of cryo solutions with increasing concentration of a cryo-agent.
These solutions are usually prepared when time is already limited, such as days or even hours before shipping the crystals to a synchrotron radiation lab.

## Scope:

- Useful for vapor diffusion, dialysis, batch, and serial dehydration experiments. 
- Supports solutions with 2 to 8 componenents other than water.
- Supports series up to 12 solutions in length.


## Sources of funding
